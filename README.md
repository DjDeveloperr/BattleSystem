# Pokémon Battle System
## What's this?
This project aims to be the best Pokémon Battle System module around, mainly for the fan-made Pokémon Game projects. I can't seem to complete this project alone, because I'm not so good with Pokémon knowledge, so I'm making this project open-source, so everyone's contributions are welcome!
This project is written in C#, and can be easily integrated into Unity projects, as far as I know.
I focus on making this easy to use, yet efficient. This is basically an event based battle system, you contruct the Battle, listen to events, and let the Battle begin!
